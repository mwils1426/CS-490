Maxwell Gorley - Engineering Notebook
Group 6 - Boeing

[Sprint 1]

9/13/2021
*First meeting with Boeing
*The goal is to emulate aircraft systems
*Each campus is assigned red/blue team

9/15/2021
*Follow-up meeting with Brian Jaury from Boeing
*Using QEMU for emulation
	- I am more familiar with VirtualBox and VMware, so this will be a challenge

9/20/2021
*Asked if we could use VirtualBox, but Brian preferred QEMU

9/27/2021
*Because we are conducting penetration testing, it is important that the VMs are in an isolated network

9/28/2021
*Finished documentation for Sprint 1
*Brian said that we should not use 2-factor authentication for SSH
*Was going to meet with Anthony in-person to help set up the network, but I had to quarantine

10/5/2021
*Presented Sprint 1

[Sprint 2]

10/11/2021
*We are using Parrot OS for penetration testing

10/19/2021
*Added non-functional/safety test cases
*Installed Parrot OS in a VM
*Experimented with several network types (NAT, bridged, host-only, etc.) to see how they work

10/26/2021
*Finished SRS and SDD for Sprint 2

10/31/2021
*Met online with Anthony and Max (Wilson) to test packet sniffer

11/2/2021
*Presented Sprint 2

[Sprint 3]

11/3/2021
*Joint meeting with the Prescott campus
	-Daytona Beach has made more progress than Prescott

11/23/2021
*Learned how to configure a TFTP server

11/29/2021
*Learned more about setting up a host-only network for QEMU
	-Very important to keep VMs isolated from the ERAU network

11/30/2021
*Finished SRS and SDD for Sprint 3

12/1/2021
*Project presentation is scheduled for December 6

12/5/2021
*QEMU network works!
	- 2 machines can communicate

12/6/2021
*Presented Sprint 3

======================================================================================================

[Sprint 4]

1/24/2022
*First Boeing meeting of the semester
*More likely to keep everything virtual rather than using physical aviation-specific network switches

1/31/2022
*Weekly meetings with Prescott start on Wednesday

2/2/2022
*First Prescott meeting
*Future Prescott meetings will be held monthly instead of weekly
*CTF will be held in 3 stages
	1. No encryption
	2. Simple encryption
	3. Advanced encryption

2/4/2022
*Finished SRS and SDD for Sprint 4

2/8/2022
*Presented Sprint 4

[Sprint 5]

2/23/2022
*Log server is working under QEMU!
*Currently one VM sending its own syslog data to Graylog
*Graylog VM uses 4 GB of RAM, but my laptop only has 8 GB of RAM, so running additional VMs could be challenging

2/27/2022
*Worked on test plan for Sprint 5

3/3/2022
*Using VirtualBox instead of QEMU for the demo
*3 VMs will be used
	- Graylog
	- Ubuntu Server, which sends logs to Graylog
	- Parrot OS, which performs the DoS attack
*Accidentally destroyed data on Ubuntu Server VM while trying to resize the partition
	- Disk was partitioned using LVM and I mistakenly deleted the LVM signature while resizing the root partition
	- Downloaded new Ubuntu Server VM from OSBoxes

3/9/2022
*Finalized VM setup and conducted DoS attack on the Graylog server
	- Graylog web interface said the site was unavailable during the DoS attack
*Reduced Graylog RAM from 4 GB to 2.5 GB
*Reduced Ubuntu Server RAM from 1 GB to 0.5 GB
*Reduced Parrot OS RAM from 2 GB to 1.5 GB

3/10/2022
*Presented Sprint 5

[Sprint 6]

3/30/2022
*IT support ticket went through, so funding should be available soon

4/11/2022
*Legal department approved funding

4/17/2022
*Cloud server was attacked and flagged for a Terms of Service violation, so we can no longer use it

4/18/2022
*Participated in Prescott CTF
*CTF was very well made
	- Prescott used CTFd as the CTF platform
*Some challenges involved aviation equipment, but we were unable to complete those

4/20/2022
*Network switch was purchased so we can network our computers together
*I learned that switches do not have built-in routing functionality
	- Either everyone would have to manually set static IP addresses or a router would have to be connected
	- I found a pfSense router VM on my laptop and it worked

4/21/2022
*Set up VirtualBox's built-in remote desktop (RDP) server and tunneled it over Ngrok so Prescott can access it
	- This lets the VM remain isolated from the Internet
		- Prescott used TeamViewer for remote access during the CTF, so their laptop had to be connected to the Internet
	- Default Windows RDP client could not connect
	- FreeRDP disconnected frequently
	- mRemoteNG worked, so Prescott can use that to connect to the VM

*Final in-class presentation scheduled for 4/26
*Final Boeing presentation scheduled for 4/29
