Aerospace Aircraft Domain Security Enhancement

Project Vision Statement

The aircraft domain is a complex system containing many critical and non-critical systems used in flight. An aircrafts network can be split into three levels: 
the Aircraft Control Domain (ACD), the Airline Information Services Domain (AISD), and the Passenger Information and Entertainment Services Domain (PIESD). 
In this project, we hope to emulate the AISD network and potentially move towards connecting it with the ACD. Once these systems are set in place, 
we will investigate how these domains can be simulated, and tested for cybersecurity.
